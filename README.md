PHP-MYSQL CRUD
These are basically the files from a video tutorial that explains the Create, Read, Update and Delete procedure in PHP using PDO queries to register, fetch, update and delete data from MYSQL database.
The config file explains the PDO way of connecting to MYSQL database.

Hope it helps new to intermediate level PHP developers to understand PHP-MYSQL interaction using secure PDO methods.
